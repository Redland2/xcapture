==Adopting a policy==

==Enforcing a policy==

A duty officer is a conference staffer who is on-hand to do first response to serious incidents, like harassment reports. See [[Conference anti-harassment/Duty officer]] for a description of duties and resources.

The key to committing to anti-harassment for your events is responding to reports as quickly as reasonably possible, with the aim of '''making your event safe from harassment'''. See [[Conference anti-harassment/Responding to reports]] for resources on how to respond when harassment is reported at your event.

==Risky events==
Some conferences or conference events and activities are more risky than others and you may wish to make special arrangements to improve people's safety at these events.
